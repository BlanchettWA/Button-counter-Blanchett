# Button-counter-Blanchett
## Kountr (WAB.TK)

Attempt to create a button counter in Android Studio.
This was a first project in [Professor Briggs'](https://github.com/kabriggs991) CSCI 490: Mobile App Development at the College of Charleston.

## Features
* Simple to use! Count up or down by touching the + or - buttons!
* Count by larger increments using the number box and leap buttons!
* Store up to four numbers! Long press the store buttons to store a number, then tap to recall it!
* Optimized landscape view!

Please contact me with any bugs or problems encountered; this is still very much a work in progress.

## Coming Eventually...
